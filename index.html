<p>My previous jobs include Associate Professor at <a href=https://www2.calstate.edu>California State University</a> and positions at NASA JPL, the Naval Research Lab, and the NSA. I received my BS from Kent State University Honors College in Computer Science, and an MS and PhD from the <a href=https://www.pitt.edu>University of Pittsburgh</a>, also in Computer Science. My thesis was on Artificial Intelligence applications on the Nursebot Project, a robotic assistant for the elderly.</p>
